          <h3>Traffic lights</h3>
          <p>
            One of the three core elements that make up SuperNightShift are the
            traffic lights. Everyone knows the problem that traffic lights have
            a big influence on how fast you, yes exactly you, get to your
            destination. As long as you are an exemplary pedestrian, of course.
            We find this mechanic super annoying, but incredibly important for a
            game about the best way through a city. We offer players live data
            of the city of Hamburg and soon many more! This makes every game
            unique, as traffic light phases can shorten or lengthen by the
            second.

        <div class="gameplayElement">
          <h3>Transport Modes</h3>
          <p>
            However, without a means of transport, even the coolest game
            mechanics are of no use if they are based on traffic lights. You can
            find these means of transport in every city. Be it the bike, car
            sharing, the bus, the train or a scooter? Each vehicle has its
            advantages and disadvantages. Since you have both a time limit and a
            travel budget with SuperNightShift, even the coolest car from Sixt
            won't do you any good if you've already burned through your budget
            after 2 minutes. So be careful which traffic mix you choose to be
            the first to reach the finish line or to set a new best time.

          <h3>Decision Making</h3>
          <p>
            Without making decisions, even drinking beer would be boring, do I
            drink it all at once or save some for later? No, seriously! Life is
            only exciting through constant decisions and the possibility to be
            right or not. That's why, in addition to finding the right way, we
            also want to make the mix of your means of transportation exciting.
            Ok, admittedly taking the bus doesn't sound exciting, but if it
            leaves you with enough budget to get a fast e-car, then I'll gladly
            take the bus for at least two more stops!
