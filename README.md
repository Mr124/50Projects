# 50Projects

I want to learn about Web Development. That's why I get my hands dirty and code :)

In this folder you find my latest projects that I'm working on according to a udemy course named similiarly. I started following the tutorial but I'm enjoying watching it less and try more on my own.

Thanks for reading my random text and have a nice day ;)
